# Landing Page Requirement Document: Inventory Management System

## 1.0 Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a public-facing landing
page for the Inventory Management System. The primary goal of this
page is to serve as the main entry point for new visitors, clearly
communicating the application's value and encouraging them to sign
up. The page will be designed to appeal to the target audience by
showcasing the system's core features in a clean, professional, and
benefit-oriented manner.

Based on the project's codebase, the application is a robust
inventory tracking tool with features for managing items,
transactions, physical locations (bins), and suppliers/markets.
The landing page will reflect this professional, data-centric
nature.

## 2.0 Target Audience

The landing page will be tailored to the following user profiles:

- Small to Medium-Sized Business (SMB) Owners: Individuals who need
  a straightforward, no-frills system to manage stock, reduce waste,
  and track assets.
- Warehouse Managers & Operations Staff: Professionals responsible
  for the logistical organization of inventory, including storage,
  tracking, and movement.
- E-commerce Sellers: Online retailers who need to accurately track
  product levels across different marketplaces or platforms.

## 3.0 Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goal: Convert visitors into registered users

### Secondary Goals

       * Clearly articulate the purpose and core benefits of the
         Inventory Management System.
       * Build trust by presenting a professional and polished brand
         image.
       * Provide clear navigation paths for new users (Sign Up) and
         existing users (Login).

## 4.0 Page Sections & Content Strategy

The landing page will be a single, responsive page composed of the
following sections:

## 4.1 Hero Section

- Objective: Immediately grab the visitor's attention and convey
  the core value proposition.
- Content:
  - Headline: A strong, benefit-focused headline. e.g.,
    "Effortless Inventory Control, From Warehouse to Sale."

    e.g., "Our intuitive platform helps you track every item,
    manage stock levels, and make data-driven decisions with
    ease."
  - Visual: A clean, professional graphic or image. The existing
    public/InventoryProcess.png could be suitable here.
  - Primary Call-to-Action (CTA): A prominent button. e.g., "Get
    Started for Free". This should link to the sign-up page.
  - Secondary CTA: A less prominent link for existing users.
    e.g., "Already have an account? Sign In".

## 4.2 Features Section

- Objective: Detail the key functionalities of the application and
  their benefits.

## 5.0 Design & Branding

  for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

  (LCP).

  <h1>, <title>, and meta descriptions).
